This is a 2d platformer game made in Godot for my game dev class.
The assignment required me to produce a game that was about the Baker Dangerous Dag collecting pies. I was provided with the assets for Dag as well as the pies.
All game sounds were gathered for free from Pixabay.

This game takes place on an oil rig and is intended to have a general industrial theme to it.
